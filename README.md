For the backend I needed to install : express , mongoose , body-parser , cors

npm install --save express
..and so on

I also choose to use dotenv so we can store the DB user/pass in a .gitignored file,
insead of the app.js file.


For the frontend I needed to install : axios ( I think that wasn't mentioned )

npm install --save axios

Frontend:
Only very tiny and small differences in EditItem.js

Backend:
No changes from the original (some comments may vary.)
