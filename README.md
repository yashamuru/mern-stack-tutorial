### Summary.  
  [This](https://appdividend.com/2017/06/28/mern-stack-tutorial/) tutorial is perfect !
  Here is my shot at it.
  I combined the two projects into a single repository for my convenience.
  The correct way to do this is to keep the original structure of 2 separate repositories.

#### Backend
- For the backend I needed to install : express , mongoose , body-parser , cors
  - `npm install --save express`
  - ..and so on

- I also choose to use dotenv so we can store the DB user/pass in a .gitignored file, instead of the app.js file.

- No changes from the original (some comments may vary.)

#### Frontend
 - For the frontend I needed to install : `axios` ( I think that wasn't mentioned )

 - `npm install --save axios`
 - Only very tiny and small differences in EditItem.js
